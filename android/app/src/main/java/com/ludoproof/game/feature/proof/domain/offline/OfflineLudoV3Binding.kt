 * Offline gameplay binding for ruleset v3.

 * EntroNex v4 still proves the unbiased random outcome. Ruleset v3 then applies
 * one deterministic gameplay transform: a player's first roll, while all four
 * tokens are still in the starting yard, is treated as six. Both the policy and
 * the opening-roll-consumed state are included in hashed material, so the bonus
 * cannot silently reappear later in the match.
