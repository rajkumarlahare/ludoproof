# Ludo Paws authored audio

This folder is the source of truth for replaceable production audio. Drop real .wav or .ogg files into the matching folders below and commit them. Android Gradle mirrors these files into APK assets at build time; do not copy them manually into res/raw.

Do not add fake, silent, or zero-byte WAVs. Empty folders use .gitkeep until an authored sound is ready.

## Background music

Folder: `audio/music/`.

Put background-music files such as `ludoproof_theme (1).wav`, `ludoproof_theme (2).wav`, and so on directly in this folder. **Keep the names exactly as they are**—the Android asset loader recognizes the original base name with a Windows duplicate suffix (` (number)`) and uses the first matching file in numeric order as the looping BGM. It falls back to the legacy `res/raw/ludoproof_theme` resource if no authored asset is present.

Important: do not leave filenames containing spaces or parentheses in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`; Android resource filenames must be resource-safe. Move those BGM files into `audio/music/` without renaming them. Gradle packages this folder as APK assets automatically.

## Windows duplicate suffixes are supported

For SFX and animal voices, files such as `lp_sfx_capture_01 (1).wav` and `lp_vocal_dog_capture_01 (2).wav` are discovered automatically alongside their canonical filename slots. Keep the added suffixes; do not rename audio files just to remove `(1)`, `(2)`, etc. Put them in the matching folder under `audio/sfx/`.

## Movement: keep jumps and footfalls separate

### Jump / hop take-off
Folder: audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/jump/
- lp_sfx_jump_01.wav — already present; used at a real hop take-off.
- lp_sfx_jump_02.wav
- lp_sfx_jump_03.wav

### Cell landing / footfall
Folder: audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/step/
- lp_sfx_step_01.wav
- lp_sfx_step_02.wav
- lp_sfx_step_03.wav

Optional character overrides:
- audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/step/dog/lp_sfx_step_dog_01.wav
- audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/step/goat/lp_sfx_step_goat_01.wav
- audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/step/duck/lp_sfx_step_duck_01.wav
- audio/sfx/gameplay/movement/step/cat/lp_sfx_step_cat_01.wav

For each character, _02.wav and _03.wav variants are supported. Character-specific footfalls are tried first, then the shared step family, then legacy raw/procedural fallbacks. A jump file is never used as an ordinary cell landing.

Sound direction: footfalls should be short and soft (roughly 40–75 ms); springy jump take-off should be distinct (roughly 90–160 ms). Dice rattle is the roll-start texture; dice settle is a brief tick when the committed/verified face appears. Keep the settle quieter than the rattle and avoid long tails that overlap with the six sparkle. These are mix/design targets, not strict file validators.

## Physical gameplay and UI effects

For each family, add the exact first filename shown. Optional _02.wav / _03.wav variants are supported and rotate when present.

| Folder | First filename | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| audio/sfx/ui/click/ | lp_sfx_ui_click_01.wav | UI click / tap |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/dice/ | lp_sfx_dice_roll_01.wav | Rolling rattle |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/dice/settle/ | lp_sfx_dice_settle_01.wav | Short landing tick when the verified face appears |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/six/ | lp_sfx_six_01.wav | Six / bonus-turn sparkle |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/yard_exit/ | lp_sfx_yard_exit_01.wav | Token launch from yard |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/capture/ | lp_sfx_capture_01.wav | Capture contact impact |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/safe/ | lp_sfx_safe_relief_01.wav | Safe-cell arrival accent |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/home_lane/ | lp_sfx_home_lane_01.wav | First home-lane entry |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/home/ | lp_sfx_home_01.wav | Home arrival |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/fail/ | lp_sfx_fail_01.wav | Soft no-legal-move / poor-roll accent |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/exact_home_miss/ | lp_sfx_exact_home_miss_01.wav | Separate gentle descending spring for a roll short of home |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/third_six/ | lp_sfx_third_six_01.wav | Third six forfeiture |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/victory/ | lp_sfx_victory_01.wav | Match / team win |
| audio/sfx/gameplay/defeat/ | lp_sfx_defeat_01.wav | Match / team loss |

## Character animal voices

Root-level authored character voices are supported under audio/sfx/voices/<character>/.

Use exact cue names and numbered variants, for example:
- audio/sfx/voices/dog/lp_vocal_dog_capture_01.wav
- audio/sfx/voices/cat/lp_vocal_cat_captured_01.ogg
- audio/sfx/voices/duck/lp_vocal_duck_home_01.wav
- audio/sfx/voices/goat/lp_vocal_goat_six_01.ogg

Supported character IDs: dog, goat, duck, cat. The reaction profile currently requests voice variants _01 and _02. Use short, non-verbal, original/licensed character takes. Normal movement and routine turn-start moments should remain vocally quiet; capture, home, third-six and final results may get a stronger reaction.

Existing Android res/raw voice names remain a compatibility fallback. If a matching root audio file exists, it is preferred.

## Technical export targets

- WAV: PCM 16-bit, mono, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz is the preferred source for physical effects.
- OGG or WAV is accepted for animal voices.
- Trim leading silence; use a clean transient and controlled tail.
- No digital clipping or unnecessarily aggressive loudness normalization.
- Keep physical SFX, animal vocals and background music as separate assets/lanes.
- A filename in this guide is a slot, not a claim that the sound file already exists.
